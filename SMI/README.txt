This package is an SMI reader for Python. It uses the libsmi library from
Frank Strauss, Technical University of Braunschweig. You should already
have this installed before beginning this installation. You can get it here:
<http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/projects/libsmi/download.html>

Take a look at the test.py script to see an example of how to use this.
