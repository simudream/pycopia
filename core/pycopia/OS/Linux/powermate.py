"""
A Python interface to the Griffin Technology PowerMate USB knob.  This
device is an aluminum dial which can measure clockwise and anticlockwise
rotation. The dial also acts as a pushbutton. The base contains an LED
which can be instructed to pulse or to switch to a particular intensity.

See http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/powermate/ for more info.

Note that you must have the Linux kernel driver for this enabled in your
kernel config (at least 2.4.22). It is listed in the USB devices section
of the config menu. The Linux hotplug scripts should load the driver if
it is a module, but it does not load the evdev module. You might have to
"modprobe evdev" first (or better yet, put that in one of your rc files.
In Gentoo Linux, place a line with "evdev" in the
/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4 file.
