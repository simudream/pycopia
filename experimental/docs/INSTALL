Installing the Python Network Management System (pyNMS)
-----------------------------------------------

1. Grab the pyNMS.tgz tarball and untar it. You have probably already
   done this. 

2. Look at pyNMS/etc/setup.sh  -- copy that into your own .profile
   startup script (or .bash_profile).  If you untarred pyNMS into some
   place other than your home directory, then adjust the PYNMS_HOME
   variable accordingly. 

3. Once those are set in your shell environment, you can then import the
   Python modules that are contained there. You should also be able to
   run the scripts in $PYNMS_HOME/bin. However, some scripts require
   other third-party Python modules that are not supplied here. Those
   need to be installed separately for your Python environment. That
   would include the Gnome/Gtk GUI interface.

4. Some modules require some external C utilities. If you are installing
   this the first time on a new machine, go to the $PYNMS_HOME/src/utils
   directory and do the following: 
   
       ./configure
       make
       su
       make sinstall

5. The SMI module requires that the libsmi library be installed first,
   and then the Python wrapper be build for it. To build the wrapper,
   run "make install" in the $PYNMS_HOME/src/SMI directory.

6. Enjoy.
