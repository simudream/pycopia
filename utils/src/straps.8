.SH NAME
straps \- A simple SNMP trap multiplexer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B straps
[
.I "port"
]
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBstraps\fR trap daemon listens on the snmp-trap port (usually
port 162/udp) for incoming SNMP trap or inform messages and forwards
them to all connected clients (like \fBscotty\fR). The optional
\fIport\fR argument allows to use the straps daemon to forward
messages received on a non standard SNMP trap port. However, port
numbers below 1024 will be rejected.

Clients connect to the \fBstraps\fR daemon by opening the AF_UNIX
domain stream socket /tmp/.straps-\fIport\fR. Thus, the default
AF_UNIX domain stream socket is named /tmp/.straps-162.

Received messages are forwarded using the following format:

.RS
.TP 10
4 byte
IP address of the sender (network-byte-order).
.TP
2 byte
Port number of the sender (network byte order).
.TP
4 byte
Length of the trap message (host-byte-order).
.TP
n bytes
The trap message itself.
.RE

The \fBstraps\fR daemon must be installed setuid root because normal
operating systems require root permissions to open the standard SNMP
trap port 162/udp. The \fBstraps\fR daemon rejects all \fIport\fR
numbers below 1024 in order to protect the system security.
