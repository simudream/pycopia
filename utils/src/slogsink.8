.SH NAME
slogsink \- A simple syslog multiplexer.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B slogsink
[
.I "port"
]
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBslogsink\fR trap daemon listens on the syslog port (usually port
514/udp) for incoming syslog messages and forwards them to all connected
clients. The optional \fIport\fR argument allows you to use the slogsink daemon
to forward messages received on a non standard port. However, port numbers
below 1024 will be rejected.

Clients connect to the \fBslogsink\fR daemon by opening the AF_UNIX
domain stream socket /tmp/.slog-\fIport\fR. Thus, the default
AF_UNIX domain stream socket is named /tmp/.slogsink-514.

Received messages are forwarded using the following format:

.RS
.TP 10
4 byte
IP address of the sender (network-byte-order).
.TP
2 byte
Port number of the sender (network byte order).
.TP
4 byte
Length of the trap message (host-byte-order).
.TP
n bytes
The trap message itself.
.RE

The \fBslogsink\fR daemon must be installed setuid root because normal
operating systems require root permissions to open the standard syslog
port 514/udp. The \fBslogsink\fR daemon rejects all \fIport\fR
numbers below 1024 in order to protect the system security.
