Pycopia QA package.

Pycopia packages to support professional QA roles.  A basic QA automation
framework. Provides base classes for test cases, test suites, test
runners, reporting, lab models, terminal emulators, remote control, and
other miscellaneous functions.


Note that this package includes some support for using "smartbits" product
from Python. However, this package is no longer maintained, and the author
can no longer test it (no available library). It's included here just in
case you want to do something with it.
