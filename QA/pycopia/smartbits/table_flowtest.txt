autocontinuous	"Enable/disable autocontinuous mode."	None	(yes, no)
buckets	"Time ranges, in microseconds, for latency counts."	None	Buckets
capture	"User-defined port names to be set up for capture."	None	Strings
capfilename	"Name of capture file. An arbitrary file name."	None	String
connect	"Chassis IP or COM Port #. There must be one connect statement for each chassis in the test. Connection is made in the order of connect statements. Only IP connections are supported here."	None	IPAddress
Delaybeforetx	"Delay, in seconds, before the SmartBits port transmits test traffic."	None	Float
framesizes	"Array of frame sizes for successive throughput tests, or a range of frame sizes in the form minimum:maximum:increment, or both of these. Frame sizes do not include CRC."	None	FrameSizes 
includegroups	"User-defined names of groups to be included in the test. Strings. The group names must have been defined in a definegroups statement."	None	GroupList
learningframesz	"Length of learning frames."	None	Integer
logfilename	"Name of log file generated by the API, telling values passed in from user."	None	String
mplslabelfilename	"If your test includes MPLS labeled flows (LIP), use this parameter to specify the name of a text file that will contain a list of the flows in your test, together with the MPLS label actually sent out for each flow."	None	String
ReportAFGRTS	"Specifies whether a report will be generated for All, Flows, Groups, RxPort, TxPort, Stream."	None	ReportFlags
reportfilename	"Name of report file generated after test ends."	None	String
SnapSC	"For SNAP test only. Specifies the start time for capture (in milliseconds after test starts) and the number of packets to capture."	None	SnapSCType
staggerstart	"Normally in SmartFlow, all ports start transmitting simultaneously. This is called a group start. If you specify a stagger start time (in milliseconds), ports will start sequentially, each successive port waiting for the specified time before starting. The start order is alphabetical based on the user-specified port names."	None	Integer
stepcount	"Number of steps in this test. When stepcount is greater than 1, the test is repeated. With each repetition, the utilization rate at each port is incremented as specified in the Test Step Rate parameter (the third parameter) in the ports statement."	None	Integer
testname	"User-defined name for test. Arbitrary string. "	None	String
